Backend Social Share
==

This module provides a link in the backend to share content directly on Facebook via [Facebook sharer](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/reference/share-dialog).

Following content types are supported:
- News
- Events
- Sermons (Link to my sermon extension)


Please note:
This plugin provides no [og-tags](http://ogp.me/ "Follow The Open Graph Protocol") which Facebook prefers.
